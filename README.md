Business Rules Engine (BRE)
---------------------------

Introduction
-----------
Welcome to my home grown Business Rules Engine.
This is my first attempt at using GO for backend development. I just competed finished 4 months (14th May 2021)  of GO training at Go School, facilitated by Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore. In fact the works listed in this repository is my submission of an assignment which comes at end of the 4 months.

Problem Statement
-----------------
Why did I choose to develop a BRE for the assignment? The BRE I developed is generic and can be used for any industry. I spent over 20 years in the Retail Industry and I wanted to use the assignment to address a real problem in the retail industry. That being the disconnect between Retail Merchandisers and IT. 
Merchandisers want to drive sales and the best way they can reach the sales target is to create innovative promotion schemes. Unfortunately, most of their creative and innovative work is restricted by the frontend systems. The purpose of the BRE is to provide dynamic processing of the promotion schemes in the frontend system.
